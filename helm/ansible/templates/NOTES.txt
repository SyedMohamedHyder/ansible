1. To grab a shell in the controller, execute the following command

    ---

    CONTROLLER=$(kubectl get pods --selector app.kubernetes.io/component=controller -o=jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
    kubectl exec -it $CONTROLLER -- /bin/bash

    ---

Once into the container, you can play around with it by running the ansible commands.

2. To execute a ping command inside the pod, you can just do

    ---

    kubectl exec $CONTROLLER -- ansible all -m ping

    ---

For scenarios, where you would need to debug the target pod, just replace the above selector with `app.kubernetes.io/component=controller`
